Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **best-case**: this is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input. In above example, the best case would be to search for the value 1. Since this is the first value of the list, it would be found in the first iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **average-case**: this is the average complexity of solving the problem. This complexity is defined with respect to the distribution of the values in the input data. Based on above sample, we could say that the average-case would be when we are searching for some value in the “middle” of the list, for example, the value 2.\n",
    "\n",
